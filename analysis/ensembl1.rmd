## 0. Introduction

This is a set of introductory hands-on exercises to get to know more about the genomes of various animals with public databases.
These exercises align the learning goals from module 1 and lectures of Bio322.
https://www.nmbu.no/course/BIO322

You can submit your answers on Canvas. 


## Task 1-1 Explore the human genome content 
Let's explore actual genome databases and get to know the genome contents and feature.

- Go to https://www.ensembl.org/index.html 

Click the following icon.
![Let's explore the human genome](assets/handson/Slide2.png)

Here, as one example, we are going to look into BRCA2 gene.

![Investigate the BRCA gene as an example](assets/handson/Slide4.png)


![You can see multiple transcripts of the BRCA2 gene](assets/handson/Slide5.png)

Click "Ontologies" and "Phenotypes" to explore the reported function of this gene.

![Scroll down to see the transcripts and regulartory regions](assets/handson/Slide6.png)

Here, there are several questions:

## Question 1 Explore the human genome

- (1-A) What mechanism generates multiple transcripts from one gene?
- (1-B) What is an enhancer, promoter, and transcription factor binding site?
- (1-C) When you want to know function of a gene, what research plan would you make?



## Task 1-2 Explore multiple genomes - genome contents

Now, we are going to compare human genome and genomes of other animals. 

Go back to the human genome page, and click "(i) More information and statistics"

![Statistics](assets/handson/Slide3.png)

## Question 2
- (2-A) How much are the Base Pairs, Coding genes, Non-coding genes, Pseudogenes, Gene transcripts in the human genome?

### Similarly, let's explore the genome of
- Chicken
- Common carp
- Saccharomyces cerevisiae (What is its common name??)

and 

- (2-A, continued)  write down: Base Pairs, Coding genes, Non-coding genes, Pseudogenes, Gene transcripts in their genomes.
If you are ambitious, make a plot of these.


- (2-B) Why is there variation in genome size and gene numbers? How they have been changed in the process of evolution?
- (2-C) How do non-coding genes work?
- (2-D) What are pseudogenes? How are they generated?
- (2-E) Which species has the most genes? What are the advantages of having many genes? 



## Task 3 Explore multiple genomes - synteny

In this task, we are going to compare the structure of multiple genomes.

SynCircos is a tool to compare the contents of chromosomes from mulciple species.
http://bioinfo.konkuk.ac.kr/synteny_portal/


First, compare chromosome 1 of human, gorilla, mouse and cow.

![four mammals](assets/handson/circos1.png)

We can see that human and gorilla have a quite similar chromosome one content. 

However, mouse has only one-third of human chromosome one's content, 
and cow's chromosome one is entirely different from human's.

So, where in the genome do cow and mouse have human chromosome one'e elements?

![four mammals](assets/handson/circos2.png)


Let's compare human chromosome one and other chromoosmes of mouse and cow. 


![four mammals](assets/handson/circos3.png)

And download the result.

## Question 3
- (3-B) Where in the genome do cow and mouse have human chromosome one's elements?


## Task 4 Explore multiple genomes - structure

In this task, we are going to compare the structure of multiple genomes.
